Our idea: Make a Friend 
The robot starts as hating you with a friendship value of -100. Using different words in your responses increases or decreases the friendship value. 
Different words have different values which can be added or subtracted from the total friendship value. For example, the word "hate" might have a friendship value of -10, but "love" might have a value of +10. 
The robot uses emoticons and langauge to indicate how happy it is with you. You have befriended it when its friendship score is 75 or higher. 
If the friendship score drops below -150, it stops responding and just tells you to shut the hell up.
